# Vagrant Sandbox

Just a quick repository where I can try out various features of vagrant.

There is really *NO* provisioning system here, so it's not possible to tell what I've done so far. Thats fine for this VM, as it's purpose is just to be a quick window into Ubuntu that I can use to try things out and pretend I'm running linux.
